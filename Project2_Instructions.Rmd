# QuickStart Data Science Bootcamp<br>Cohorts 3 and 4 - Jonathan Fowler

## Project 2 (R)

For this project, think of yourself as a developer on a corporate business intelligence team. You have been given a flat file (CSV format) of login information from Maximo, an asset tracking system the company relies on. Current licensing requires that no more than 95 users in the AUTHORIZED and/or LIMITED groups be online at any given time. The deliverables outlined in this project will be submitted to the IT director, who wants to be sure that the licensing threshold is not exceeded.

### The Data

The data is included in this project. The filename is **Project2Data.csv**.

| Field     | Description   |
|-----------|--------------|
| attemptdate        | Date and Time of event          |
| attemptresult | LOGIN, LOGOUT, TIMEOUT, or SYSLOGOUT |
| userid  | The user triggering the event |
| type      | User type, i.e., AUTHORIZED |
| maxsessionuid   | Unique identifer for a session. This will show up from LOGIN to LOGOUT, TIMEOUT, or SYSLOGOUT. |

### Part 1

Let's answer some basic questions about the dataset. You may insert your code below each of these lines.  

**Prework: Load the CSV file into your environment.**  
```
data <- read.csv(file = 'Project2Data.csv')
```
**1. How many unique users? A simple number will do here, no tables or formatting needed.**  
```
unique(data$userid)
```
**2. How many unique levels, unique users in each? I want a table that shows this information together.**  
```
rollup(data, j = count(userid), by = c("type")) # default id=FALSE
```
**3. What is the average session time for each unique group?**  
```
# insert your code that produces the correct result here
```
**4. Which users have more than one session going at the same time?**  
```
# insert your code that produces the correct result here
```

### Part 2

Your objective in this part is to create a Gantt chart that shows the following:  
1. One unique userid per row <br>
2. A Gantt chart on the right <br>
3. Blocks of time representing when each user logged in, mapped on the time field <br>
4. User's time blocks colored by which group they belong to <br>

You're dealing with a lot of data, so a single chart that shows all users for the whole month would be impossible to read. How are you going to break this out into multiple, manageable charts? It's okay to produce a chart for each week in the month. Just show the code that creates all the charts. **If you determine a Gantt chart is not appropriate, show me the Gantt anyway and then explain why your changes make sense.**

```
# insert your code that produces the correct result here; this should include your data wrangling and ggplot2 construction
```

### Part 3

This project required you to think critically about the request(s) you were given, clarify information from the customer, and work together as a team. In the section below, please write a short paragraph that answers the following questions: 
1. Did the Gantt chart request make sense? What was your process in determining how to show the data?<br>
2. What sort of cleaning did you have to do to the data? What data points did you remove and why?<br>
3. Did you find it difficult to ask the customer (me) clarifying questions?<br>
4. Did you take advantage of the student worksessions? How did those help you?<br>
5. How have you grown as a practitioner through the course of this project?<br>

```
#
# Your answer to Part 3 will go here
# It's code but with a comment character in front
# So it won't run, but I'll see the text
#
```

### Submissions

Because we all will be working with the same data, you will only need to send me an updated version of this Markdown file. Please save it as *lastname_firstinitial_Project2.Rmd* and email to me directly at [jonathan.fowler@quickstart.com](mailto:jonathan.fowler@quickstart.com). Submissions must be made by **May 22 2020 11:59PM ET**.

#### R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
